This is a [React](https://react.dev/) app with [fal](https://fal.ai) that demonstrates real-time AI image generation based on drawings in a canvas.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Now you can run the Next.js project as usual:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Note:** although the commands above use `npm`, feel free to use your preferred package manager,
